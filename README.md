# Advanced Multiple Regression Project
 
This project applies advanced multiple regression analysis on a data set of 1,267 substances with 229 characteristics, including their solubility. The data was divided into two files: the training file comprising 951 substances and the testing file with 316 substances. 

I build three models using three multiple regression algorithms. The algorithms were: Original Logistic Regression (OLS), Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression.  

This project includes a solution in Python using the SKlearn library. It includes exploratory data analysis and data preparation, which were performed once. For each model, it included cross-validation, performance analysis, and model linearity assessment. At the end of the notebook, I compare performance results across all three models.
